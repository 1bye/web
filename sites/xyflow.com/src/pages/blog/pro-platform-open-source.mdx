We‚Äôre excited to announce that we just open sourced our Pro Platform! üéâ¬†Our Pro Platform is the website that allows React Flow Pro subscribers to access and view ‚Äú[Pro Examples](https://reactflow.dev/pro/examples),‚Äù manage their subscription, and give team members access to the platform.

When we created the Pro Platform last year, it was developed in a way that made the Pro Examples (which are not open source) inseparable from the platform that was hosting them. We spent time this year rebuilding the pro platform from the ground up and ready to be open sourced. Feels much better this way as a company with OSS at our core.

We hope that some folks take a look, get inspired for their own projects, and that our Pro Subscribers like the new features built in for the refresh üí´

Check out the Github repo: [@xyflow/pro-platform](https://github.com/xyflow/pro-platform)

Create an account on the platform: [pro.reactflow.dev/dashboard](https://pro.reactflow.dev/dashboard) (correct link?)

# New Features

### Fresh look, new example viewer, better usability ü™©

It looks ‚ú®better‚ú®¬†and it‚Äôs easier to get around. There‚Äôs a new Example Viewer which is faster because we don‚Äôt build the whole example on the client anymore.

### Add and manage team members ‚öΩÔ∏è

In order to add new team members, you used to have to email us (ugh) and we‚Äôd manually add your new team members to the database (ughhh). Now you can automatically add and delete team members, or add additional emails to your subscription plan. You can find more about inviting team members in our [Pro FAQs](https://reactflow.dev/pro).

### Refreshed Pro Examples

[Dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre) no longer has the ‚Äúdeprecated‚Äù tag! Our Workflow builder and Expand / Collapse pro examples have been rebuilt with dagre, so that you can switch between the d3 and dagre versions.

The Shapes Pro example has been refactored, and now includes features to drag-and-drop shape nodes, resize, a color picker, dark mode, and an updated minimap. in the next months we plan to refactor some others as well, so keep your eyes out for those updates.

[shapes-3.mov](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d2a92f9d-ed0b-4bf7-88ed-335b76d8d166/6f5c98c5-1b14-4003-8f3a-01e7e4bc5474/shapes-3.mov)

You can now fire up our Pro examples now using Vite (instead of create-react-app).

### Under the hood improvements üèé

In the new platform, we have migrated to the latest Nextjs version (using app router), replaced ChakraUI with TailwindCSS and our own UI package, and converted everything from JS to Typescript.

# What do you think?

If you take a look, or would like to try using the platform for your own projects, we‚Äôd love to hear from you! We‚Äôre still working on the documentation on how to easily set this up and get it integrated with Nhost, mailjet, Stripe, etc.

And if you‚Äôd like to sign up for React Flow Pro, you can learn more about subscriptions at https://pro.reactflow.dev/.

Cheers!

The xyflow team
