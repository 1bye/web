import ExampleViewer from '@/components/example-viewer';
import ExampleLayout from '@/layouts/example-with-frontmatter';

<ExampleLayout>
Svelte Flow has built-in support for different marker types for your edges. It's possible to add your own [SVG markers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/marker), too.

<ExampleViewer codePath="examples/edges/edge-markers" framework="svelte" />
</ExampleLayout>
